## Overview
  Original complete date: 29th October 2019
  We were provided with sound clips which we had to go ahead and produce a Daft Punk Soundboard. This was one of my favourite homework to complete as it was fun and really rewarding once I managed to get the first sound card to work. We were given half a day to complete.

### How to Play
  Click on each sound card to produce a sound or use the letters on your keyboard (Q, W , E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, P, A, S, D, F, G, H)
